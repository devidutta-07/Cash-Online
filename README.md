# 💸 Cash ↔ Online Exchange (GIET Campus Project)

---

## 🔑 What is this Project?  
A **student-initiated service** to solve a very common campus problem:  

Sometimes students urgently need **cash in hand** or a quick **online transfer**, but:  
- 🏦 ATMs don’t work  
- 🤷 Friends are not available  
- 🚫 UPI/Net Banking fails  

This project enables **safe, direct, face-to-face exchange** inside GIET campus:  
- 🔄 **Cash → Online Transfer**  
- 🔄 **Online Transfer → Cash**  
- 💸 **Small fixed service fee** (transparent & fair)
